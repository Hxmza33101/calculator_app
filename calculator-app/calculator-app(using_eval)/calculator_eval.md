# Calculator App (using eval())

This is a calculator app I made on my own. For this app, I used JavaScript's inbuilt `eval` function. The reason I made this distinction is because, due to another project ideas repository, a requirement/constraint is to not use the `eval` method. Therefore, I will try again within another folder without using the `eval` function.
